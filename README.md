# How to contribute

To setup the environment

```
npm install
bower install

......

npm test
```

The best way to get your changes merged back into core is as follows:

1) Clone down your fork
2) Create a thoughtfully named topic branch to contain your change
3) Hack away
4) Add tests and make sure everything still passes by running `npm test`
5) If you are adding new functionality, document it in the README
6) Do not change the version number, we will do that on our end
7) If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors
8) Push the branch up to GitHub
9) Send a pull request for your branch
